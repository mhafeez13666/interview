# Q1: Given an array of integers, find out if the numbers are in a pyramid fashion. That is, the sorting is ascending and then descends after that.

eg: <br>
{1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1} is a pyramid<br>
{1,2,9,45,67,2,1,0} is a pyramid<br>
{1,4,6,7,8,9,3,2,5,2} is not a pyramid<br>

Possible answer: gpon.c

# Q2: Given a large positive integer, print the number in the format of thousands, millions, billions separating each by a comma.

eg: <br>

12345 should be printed as 12,345<br>
1876345 should be printed as 1,876,345<br>
8374780855 should be printed as 8,374,780,855<br>

Possible answer: nutx.c

# Q3: Write a C++ code for a implementation of hash table with a linkedlist to handle collisions

eg: <br>

Possible answer: main.cpp
