# Some coding Interview questions
Thes are some coding questions asked in "Engineering/Senior Engineering" manager Interview rounds, so if you are a SDE-III or someone then these are not for you. Also, I didn't sign any NDA or something that I shouldn't share these.

### Q1: Given an array of integers, find out if the numbers are in a pyramid fashion. That is, the sorting is ascending and then descends after that.

eg: <br>
> {1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1} is a pyramid<br>
> {1,2,9,45,67,2,1,0} is a pyramid<br>
> {1,4,6,7,8,9,3,2,5,2} is not a pyramid<br>
>
> Possible answer: gpon.c

### Q2: Given a large positive integer, print the number in the format of thousands, millions, billions separating each by a comma.

eg: <br>

> 12345 should be printed as 12,345<br>
> 1876345 should be printed as 1,876,345<br>
> 8374780855 should be printed as 8,374,780,855<br>
>
> Possible answer: nutx.c

### Q3: Write a C++ code for a implementation of hash table with a linkedlist to handle collisions

eg: <br>

> Possible answer: main.cpp

### Q4: Write a rolling hash function in C which can be used for Rabin Karp Algorithm

eg: <br>

> Possible answer: rollingHash.c
